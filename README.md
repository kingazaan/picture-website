# picture-website
This code will create a website that will modify any pictures you upload in 6 different ways

I utilized Flask, HTML, and CSS in this website. I also used different modules such as Pillow, PyTorch, Glitch_this and the Colorization model (credits are down below).

The functionality of the site is simple. In the main page, theere is a brief desciption on what the site does. In the GLitch It orute, theres is a submit button for anypicture file . After a user submits, they can sue 1 of 6 diferent filtering methods for an image. Blur, Grayscale, Reflect, Invert, Reoclor, and Glitch. The cool thig aboutit is that it will show up inthe site, and a user is able to download the file after.

Finally, the examples page shoowsk some examples of what the outcomes for each file moight be.

Any question let me know!
